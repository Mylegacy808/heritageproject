📄 Counter Summary and Progress Calculation
(Added June 2025 — Final Version)

This table includes a live summary counter that calculates:

🟠 Number of immigrants still marked as "Still searching"

🟢 Number of immigrants marked as "Info Received"

📋 Total number of records in the table

✅ % Progress (percentage of Info Received out of total records)

The counter is generated by a JavaScript function (updateStatusSummary) that loops through all table rows (not just the current page), extracts the Status text, and performs a case-insensitive match to ensure accurate counts regardless of capitalization or formatting in the HTML.

This feature ensures that viewers, team members, and grantors can quickly see overall project progress at a glance — and supports quarterly reporting and historical tracking of project growth.
