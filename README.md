## **IMPORTANT ‚Äî How to UPDATE the table (Step-by-step)**

When you receive new information and want to mark a name as "Info Received":

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the HTML file (`IMMIGRANT_STATUS_FINAL_STYLED.html`) in a text editor (such as **Notepad++**, **VS Code**, or even basic Notepad).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use the editor‚Äôs **Search** function to locate the person‚Äôs name.

3Ô∏è‚É£ You will find a row that looks like this:

```html
<td class="status-cell still-searching">Still searching</td>
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Change that row to:

```html
<td class="status-cell info-received">Info Received</td>
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Save the file.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Open `IMMIGRANT_STATUS_FINAL_STYLED.html` in your browser.  
‚úÖ The **Progress Bar** will update automatically ‚Äî no need to touch the script.

‚úÖ You can also use the table‚Äôs built-in **Search box** to filter and see only "Info Received" names.

## **IMPORTANT ‚Äî How to PRINT "Info Received" names for GRANT REPORTS (every 3 months)**

**DO NOT generate a new file ‚Äî just use the STYLED version (easy and fast!).**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Open `IMMIGRANT_STATUS_FINAL_STYLED.html` in Chrome (or your favorite browser).

2Ô∏è‚É£ In the table‚Äôs **Search box** (top right), type:

```
Info Received
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ The table will automatically filter to display only names marked as "Info Received."

4Ô∏è‚É£ Press:

- **Ctrl+P** (Windows)  
- **Cmd+P** (Mac)  

5Ô∏è‚É£ In the Print window, choose **Save as PDF** (recommended), or print on paper.

‚úÖ This is the EASIEST way to generate a report for your grant every 3 months.

## **Why use this method**

- You do not need to modify the PRINT version every time.  
- You do not need to regenerate the table.  
- The STYLED version handles this perfectly ‚Äî with Search + Print.

‚úÖ This saves time and ensures your Progress Bar stays correct!
